## 📃 Description

HabitsApp is a habit tracker app which encourages users to track their daily habits to build discipline and solid routines. The app currently allows users to create an account, create new habits and update them, see a list of their previously created habits, and delete unneeded habits. Each habit also features an activity history which allows users to mark habits as done for the specified period, thus displaying them in the log.

## 🔍 Background Information

Our group ([Sadeq Talaq](https://github.com/smhatc), [Abdulla Shaker](https://github.com/xAbdullaShaker), [Ahmed Jassim](https://github.com/Ahmed0173)) is creating this project as part of our studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.

The reason we chose to create a habit tracker app as our project is because we believe it is a perfect balance between difficulty and intrigue, allowing us to sharpen our MERN stack skills while still developing something many people use as part of their daily lives.
